        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Guatemalan history is a tapestry woven with the threads of ancient civilizations, colonial influence, and a
            rich cultural mosaic. The region that is now Guatemala was once home to advanced Mayan civilizations, with
            cities like Tikal standing as testaments to their architectural and intellectual achievements. Spanish
            colonization in the 16th century left an indelible mark on the country, influencing its culture, language,
            and religious practices. Guatemala gained independence from Spanish rule in 1821 and later became part of
            the short-lived Central American Federation. The subsequent years were marked by political turmoil, social
            inequality, and civil unrest. The latter half of the 20th century saw Guatemala grappling with a protracted
            civil war, leaving a lasting impact on its society. In recent times, efforts to preserve indigenous
            cultures, promote social justice, and strengthen democratic institutions reflect a nation determined to
            embrace its complex history while forging a path toward a more inclusive and harmonious future.</p>

        <p>Learn about three influential Guatemalans who have played crucial roles in shaping the country's cultural
            identity:</p>

        <div class="figure">
            <h3>Rigoberta Menchú</h3>
            <div class="figure-photo">
                <div class="figure-image">

                <div class="figure-desc">
                    <p>Rigoberta Menchú is a Guatemalan human rights activist who is renowned for advocating for the
                        rights of indigenous peoples. She gained international prominence in the 1980s when she brought
                        attention to the horrific acts of genocide committed against Maya peoples during Guatemala's
                        civil war.</p>
                    <p>Menchú was born in 1959 to a poor indigenous family and worked as a human rights activist and
                        organizer from a young age. In 1983, she published a book about her life called 'I, Rigoberta
                        Menchú' which exposed the brutal repression of Guatemala's indigenous communities to the wider
                        world. She went into exile due to death threats and political persecution.</p>
                    <p>In 1992, Menchú was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her dedicated work promoting social justice
                        and ethno-cultural reconciliation. She used the Nobel Peace Prize money to create the Rigoberta
                        Menchú Tum Foundation which supports community development projects for Guatemala's indigenous
                        population.</p>
                    <p>Over her long activist career, Menchú has served as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and ran for
                        Guatemalan president in 2007 and 2011. She continues to be an influential advocate for
                        indigenous rights, women's rights, and ending discrimination globally. Through her courageous
                        activism in the face of repression, Menchú has become a symbol of peaceful resistance for
                        vulnerable communities around the world.</p>

            <h3>Miguel Ángel Asturias</h3>
            <div class="figure-photo">
                <div class="figure-image">

                <div class="figure-desc">
                    <p>Miguel Angel Asturias was a Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan novelist, poet, and diplomat. He was
                        an influential literary figure in Latin America, known for combining indigenous influences,
                        surrealism, and experimental techniques in his work.</p>

                    <p>Asturias was born in Guatemala City in 1899. He studied literature and humanities at the
                        University of San Carlos. His early writings focused on the culture and legends of indigenous
                        Mayan communities in Guatemala. His first major novel, Leyendas de Guatemala, was published in
                        1930.</p>

                    <p>In the 1940s and 1950s, Asturias lived in exile in Argentina and Chile as a vocal critic of
                        repressive Guatemalan regimes. Major novels from this period include El Señor Presidente and
                        Hombres de maíz. In 1967, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Latin American
                        author to receive this honor.</p>

                    <p>Asturias served as the Guatemalan ambassador to France in the 1960s. He promoted Mesoamerican
                        culture internationally through his writing and lectures. Asturias combined stylistic
                        innovations from many literary influences but maintained a strong social conscience and deep
                        concern for indigenous rights and justice throughout his career.</p>

                    <p>Asturias died in Madrid in 1974. He is remembered as a pioneering voice in Latin American
                        literature and one of Guatemala's most acclaimed authors. His work synthesized European
                        avant-garde styles and pre-Columbian mythology in unique and groundbreaking ways.</p>

            <h3>Jacobo Árbenz</h3>
            <div class="figure-photo">
                <div class="figure-image">
                    <img src="./assets/figures/jacobo-arbenz.jpg" alt="Jacobo Árbenz">

                <div class="figure-desc">
                    <p>Jacobo Arbenz was a Guatemalan military officer and politician who served as president of
                        Guatemala from 1951 to 1954. He enacted major land reforms that challenged the entrenched
                        economic power of foreign-owned corporations and Guatemalan elites.</p>

                    <p>Arbenz was born in 1913 and graduated from the Guatemalan Military Academy. He participated in
                        the uprising that overthrew dictator Jorge Ubico in 1944. As president, Arbenz legalized the
                        Guatemalan Labor Party and won the country's first democratic elections in 1950.</p>

                    <p>As president, Arbenz expropriated unused land owned by the U.S.-based United Fruit Company to
                        redistribute to landless peasants. This was part of his Agrarian Reform Law. In 1954, his
                        progressive policies led the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to orchestrate a coup against him,
                        ushering in decades of military dictatorships.</p>

                    <p>After the coup, Arbenz lived the rest of his life in exile. He resided in Switzerland, Cuba,
                        Uruguay, and Mexico until his death in 1971. Arbenz is remembered as a champion of land reform
                        and workers' rights who challenged unjust economic exploitation in Guatemala. His presidency and
                        ouster marked a pivotal moment in Guatemalan and Latin American history.</p>

                    <p>Despite his short time in office, Arbenz's social democratic policies inspired later reform
                        movements in Latin America and beyond. He remains a symbol of nationalism and principled
                        resistance in the face of corporate and foreign political intervention.</p>

        <h2>Cultural Practices</h2>
        <p>Guatemala boasts a rich tapestry of cultural practices that reflect the diverse heritage of its indigenous
            communities. One prominent cultural practice is the traditional Mayan ceremony known as the "K'iche' New
            Year." Celebrated in the highlands, this ceremony marks the beginning of a new agricultural cycle.
            Participants engage in elaborate rituals, including the lighting of ceremonial fires, the offering of
            symbolic items, and traditional dances that honor the connection between the community and the natural
            world. The K'iche' New Year serves as a testament to the enduring indigenous traditions that have persisted
            for centuries, fostering a sense of communal identity and respect for the environment.</p>

        <p>Another integral cultural practice in Guatemala is the vibrant art of traditional weaving. Woven textiles,
            known as "huipiles" and "cortes," play a central role in expressing cultural identity and heritage. Each
            region and indigenous group in Guatemala boasts distinct weaving patterns and designs, often carrying
            symbolic meanings that convey stories of their history and beliefs. The intricate craftsmanship involved in
            weaving has been passed down through generations, and the vibrant colors and patterns showcased in these
            textiles not only serve as expressions of creativity but also as powerful symbols of cultural pride. Weaving
            represents a living art form that connects Guatemalans to their roots, fostering a sense of continuity and
            reverence for the cultural practices that define their unique identity.</p>
