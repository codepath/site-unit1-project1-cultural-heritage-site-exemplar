        <h2>Cultural Practices</h2>
        <p>Guatemala boasts a rich tapestry of cultural practices that reflect the diverse heritage of its indigenous
            communities. One prominent cultural practice is the traditional Mayan ceremony known as the "K'iche' New
            Year." Celebrated in the highlands, this ceremony marks the beginning of a new agricultural cycle.
            Participants engage in elaborate rituals, including the lighting of ceremonial fires, the offering of
            symbolic items, and traditional dances that honor the connection between the community and the natural
            world. The K'iche' New Year serves as a testament to the enduring indigenous traditions that have persisted
            for centuries, fostering a sense of communal identity and respect for the environment.</p>

        <p>Another integral cultural practice in Guatemala is the vibrant art of traditional weaving. Woven textiles,
            known as "huipiles" and "cortes," play a central role in expressing cultural identity and heritage. Each
            region and indigenous group in Guatemala boasts distinct weaving patterns and designs, often carrying
            symbolic meanings that convey stories of their history and beliefs. The intricate craftsmanship involved in
            weaving has been passed down through generations, and the vibrant colors and patterns showcased in these
            textiles not only serve as expressions of creativity but also as powerful symbols of cultural pride. Weaving
            represents a living art form that connects Guatemalans to their roots, fostering a sense of continuity and
            reverence for the cultural practices that define their unique identity.</p>
