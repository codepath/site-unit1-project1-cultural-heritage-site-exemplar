        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Guatemalan history is a tapestry woven with the threads of ancient civilizations, colonial influence, and a
            rich cultural mosaic. The region that is now Guatemala was once home to advanced Mayan civilizations, with
            cities like Tikal standing as testaments to their architectural and intellectual achievements. Spanish
            colonization in the 16th century left an indelible mark on the country, influencing its culture, language,
            and religious practices. Guatemala gained independence from Spanish rule in 1821 and later became part of
            the short-lived Central American Federation. The subsequent years were marked by political turmoil, social
            inequality, and civil unrest. The latter half of the 20th century saw Guatemala grappling with a protracted
            civil war, leaving a lasting impact on its society. In recent times, efforts to preserve indigenous
            cultures, promote social justice, and strengthen democratic institutions reflect a nation determined to
            embrace its complex history while forging a path toward a more inclusive and harmonious future.</p>
